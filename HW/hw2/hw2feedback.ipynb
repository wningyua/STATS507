    "__Remark: For this homework, do not use \"input\" in your code!!!__\n",
    "\n",
    "I discussed Problem 3.2 and 7.2 with Ming-chen Lu. \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework assignment took me 13 hours in total to complete. (Please help us to gauge the difficulty of the assignment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission Instructions\n",
    "Your homework solutions should be written entirely in this Jupyter notebook file. Once it contains your solutions, you should submit this notebook through Canvas. Before submitting, please make sure to Cells->Run All executes without errors; errors in your code translate directly to point deductions. Thus, even though we may ask you to check for errors in your functions, you should not include in your submission any examples of your functions actually raising those errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework tips\n",
    "Start early! If you run into trouble installing things or importing packages, it’s best to find those problems well in advance, not the night before your assignment is due when we cannot help you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you back up your work! At a minimum, do your work in a Dropbox folder. Better yet, use git, which is well worth your time and effort to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to follow directions! Remember that Python is case sensitive. If you are ask you to define a function called my_function and you define a function called My_Function, you will not receive full credit. You may want to copy-paste the function names below to make sure that the functions in your notebook match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nbgrader\n",
    "We will be using nbgrader to grade your jupyter notebook. You will notice some read-only cells in the assignment that contain assert statements. These are tests that your code must pass for your solution to be correct. If any of the tests fail, you will get an python error and not get points for that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The tests shown not comprehensive, so you are encouraged to read the problem carefully and verify your code covers all possible cases.\n"

    "3. <b>(2 points)</b> Write a function called `rotate_tuple` that takes two arguments: a tuple and an integer, in that order. Letting $n$ be the integer given in the input, your function should return a tuple of the same length as the input tuple, but with its entries “rotated” by n. If n is positive, this should mean to “push forward” all the entries of the input tuple by n entries, with entries that “go off the end” of the tuple being wrapped around to the beginning, so that the $i^{th}$ entry of the input tuple becomes the $(i + n)^{th}$ entry of the output, wrapping around to the beginning of the tuple if this index goes off the end. If n is negative, then this corresponds to rotating the entries in the other direction, with entries of the input tuple being “pushed backward”. Your function should perform error checking to ensure that the inputs are of appropriate types. If the user supplies a non-integer, print a message to alert the user that the input was not as expected, and try to recover by casting it to an integer. __Hint__: a try/catch statement will likely be useful here."
